## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This report documents my first attempts of using Git and GitHub to version control on RStudio project. I will be modifying this report, staging and committing changes and then pushing to GitHub.

Let's creat a test plot of distance (miles) and speed (mph).

```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the dataframe is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
